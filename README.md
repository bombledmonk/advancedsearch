This script is a hobby and as such may have some bugs or flaws, but it is intended to be a test bed for trying things that could be helpful for people on a quest to find parts.  Many functions are modular and can individually be disabled or enabled based on user preferences.  Inspiration for this userscript came from the now retired Digi-Key Sort By Price that added the then lacking title function to DigiKey's website.

### Requirements
This script is updated and tested on the most current official releases of Firefox/Chrome and Tampermonkey. 

This script is not designed with small screens in mind.  A 900p or larger screen is recommended for the best experience.
